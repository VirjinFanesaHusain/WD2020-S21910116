            <a href="">The Story of Cinderella</a> opens as Cinderella's life changes for the worse 
            when her widower father leaves on a business trip, no sooner is he out of sight 
            than Cinderella's stepmother has unceremoniously moved her two own daughters into Cinderella's room, thrown out her things, handed her a servant's dress 
            and put her to brutal harsh menial labor, the series covers Cinderella's trials 
        </p>
        <p class="success feedback">
            and tribulations as she tries to adapt to her new life 
            while suffering the abuse of her stepmother 
            and her two stepsisters, all the while, her fairy godmother, Paulette, subtly watches her
            and tries to influence events to fix Cinderella's life without her noticing
        </p>
        <p>
            one of her first acts in this is to grant several of the animals of the house 
            the power of speech, thus, giving Cinderella companions in her dog Patch
            a pair of mice named Chuchu and Bingo, and a bird named Pappy,
        </p>
        <p>
            the animals provide her company as well as help with her chores, the biggest twist in the series
            is that Cinderella meets her Prince Charming early - except here he's the roguish Prince Charles, 
            who has a habit of sneaking out of the castle
